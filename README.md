AstrBot is an open-source all-in-one Agent chatbot platform that integrates with mainstream instant messaging apps. It provides reliable and scalable conversational AI infrastructure for individuals, developers, and teams. Whether you're building a personal AI companion, intelligent customer service, automation assistant, or enterprise knowledge base, AstrBot enables you to quickly build production-ready AI applications within your IM platform workflows.

This repository is a modernized fork of AstrBot. The code, commands, deployment files, and compatibility expectations documented here describe this fork only: Python 3.14+, `uv` for backend workflows, `corepack pnpm` for the dashboard, and no legacy compatibility shims.

## Quick Start

### Run from Source

This fork currently publishes neither a PyPI package nor prebuilt release assets. The package named `astrbot` on PyPI, AUR packages, and upstream container images do not represent this branch. Run the current code from a checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xero-Team/AstrBot.git
cd AstrBot
uv sync --locked
cd dashboard
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm build
cd ..
uv run python scripts/sync_dashboard_dist.py
uv run main.py
```

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node.js 24.15.0, and Corepack first. The checkout pins Python 3.14.6 and the required pnpm version. On first startup, open `http://localhost:6185` and use the random password printed in the log; the default username is `astrbot`.

If you enable local text-to-image or plugin HTML rendering, also run `uv run astrbot install-browser` once. See [Deploy AstrBot from Source](docs/en/deploy/astrbot/cli.md) for updates, remote access, and security guidance.

### Docker Deployment

This fork does not publish an official prebuilt image. Build from the current checkout. Because the Dashboard securely binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, first add `ASTRBOT_DASHBOARD_HOST=0.0.0.0` under the `astrbot` service's `environment` section if the host must access the containerized WebUI:

```yaml
environment:
  - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
  - ASTRBOT_DASHBOARD_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

Then build and start it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xero-Team/AstrBot.git
cd AstrBot
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f astrbot
```

If you want to start AstrBot and NapCat together from this repository:

```bash
docker compose -f compose-with-napcat.yml up -d --build
```

Binding to `0.0.0.0` is an explicit exposure choice. Restrict access with a firewall and preferably an HTTPS reverse proxy. More details: [Deploy AstrBot with Docker](docs/en/deploy/astrbot/docker.md).
