# Launcher Deployment (Unsupported in This Fork)

This fork does not support deployment through AstrBot Launcher or the legacy installer flow.

## What That Means

- This fork does not publish launcher-compatible packages.
- This fork does not maintain the launcher download target, dashboard asset distribution, or old installer workflow.
- Even if an external launcher can start some version, that does not mean it stays aligned with this repository's code, docs, and built assets.

## Use These Instead

- [Docker](/en/deploy/astrbot/docker)
- [Manual Deployment](/en/deploy/astrbot/cli)
- [Kubernetes](/en/deploy/astrbot/kubernetes)

If you want a local-source + container workflow, use the Docker Compose path maintained in this repository.
