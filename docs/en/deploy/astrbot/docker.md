# Deploy AstrBot with Docker

This fork does not publish a prebuilt container image. Build the image from the
current checkout so the backend and Dashboard stay version-matched.

## Build from Source

Clone this repository and build from its root `Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.docs`,
and Compose files when you need the full profile, custom runtime features, or
the locally built documentation site.

## Choose a Compose File

The repository provides two locally built deployment paths:

- `compose.yml`: runs AstrBot and the locally built static documentation site. Use it for QQ Official Bot, Telegram, Discord, and other platforms, or when you manage the bot protocol implementation separately.
- `compose-with-napcat.yml`: runs AstrBot, the static documentation site, and NapCat together for personal QQ accounts. AstrBot and the documentation are still built from the local checkout; NapCat uses the referenced NapCat container image.

Clone the repository first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xero-Team/AstrBot.git
cd AstrBot
```

## Container Listener and Host Ports

The Compose deployments explicitly set the container's WebUI listener to `0.0.0.0`; otherwise the host cannot reach the published port. Host ports bind to `127.0.0.1` by default. For remote access, explicitly set `ASTRBOT_BIND_ADDRESS` and configure a firewall or HTTPS reverse proxy.

For example:

```bash
ASTRBOT_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 docker compose up -d --build
```

`ASTRBOT_DASHBOARD_HOST` takes precedence over `dashboard.host` in `data/cmd_config.json`.

> [!CAUTION]
> `0.0.0.0` makes the WebUI listen on every container interface. Do not expose the admin panel directly to the public internet. Restrict firewall access and use a reverse proxy, HTTPS, a strong password, and TOTP.

The default AstrBot service is unprivileged and does not mount
`/var/run/docker.sock`. In the NapCat Compose file, NapCat remains
`privileged: true` for its QQ/desktop runtime; AstrBot itself is unprivileged
but keeps the docker.sock mount. Computer-tool Docker access is opt-in via the
`computer` profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile computer up -d --build computer
```

That starts the `computer` service (AstrBot plus docker.sock) instead of the
default `astrbot` service. Do not run both at once or the published ports will
conflict. The static documentation service remains read-only and unprivileged.

## Start AstrBot and the Documentation Site

The root `compose.yml` uses the root Dockerfile's `runtime` stage to build the current checkout as `astrbot:local`; the documentation image is `astrbot-docs:local`. The Dockerfile's `dev` stage remains available for the development tool environment:

```bash
docker build --target dev -t astrbot:dev .
```

### Select Runtime Features

`ASTRBOT_FEATURES` is a Docker **build argument**, not a runtime container
environment variable. Compose passes it to the Dockerfile's `runtime` stage.
It defaults to `full`, which preserves the complete feature set. Changing it
requires rebuilding the image; an existing container is not changed in place.
Use one of these forms:

Set it for one build only:

```bash
ASTRBOT_FEATURES=minimal docker compose up -d --build
```

Persist it in a `.env` file at the project root (Compose loads this file
automatically):

```dotenv
ASTRBOT_FEATURES=browser,documents,media,ocr,fonts,node,docker
```

Override `.env` from the command line when needed:

```bash
ASTRBOT_FEATURES=browser,node,docker docker compose up -d --build
```

The NapCat stack uses the same argument:

```bash
ASTRBOT_FEATURES=browser,node,docker \
  docker compose -f compose-with-napcat.yml up -d --build
```

Available feature groups:

- `browser`: Chromium and its system dependencies.
- `documents`: Pandoc, Poppler, TeX, and related fonts.
- `media`: FFmpeg, ImageMagick, Ghostscript, and codec libraries.
- `ocr`: Tesseract with English and Simplified Chinese data.
- `fonts`: runtime font families and fontconfig.
- `node`: Node.js, npm, npx, and pnpm for MCP launchers.
- `docker`: Docker CLI and Compose plugin.

Note that `node` is not required to serve the WebUI. The Dashboard is built
with Node.js in the Dockerfile's `builder` stage, and the generated static
files are copied into the `runtime` image. AstrBot's Python/FastAPI service
serves those files at runtime, so the `minimal` profile still includes and
serves the WebUI. Add `node` only for Node-based MCP launchers or other
Node.js integrations.

For example:

```bash
docker compose config
```

Use this command to inspect the final `ASTRBOT_FEATURES` build argument passed
by Compose. The `minimal` profile keeps the Python application and core shell
utilities; enable the groups required by your integrations explicitly.
The builder still retains the toolchain needed to produce the Dashboard and
documentation, while the selected features affect the final runtime image.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f astrbot docs
```

Its default mount and published ports are:

- `./data` -> `/AstrBot/data`: configuration, database, plugins, and other runtime data.
- `127.0.0.1:6185:6185`: AstrBot WebUI.
- `127.0.0.1:6199:6199`: optional OneBot v11 reverse WebSocket endpoint.
- `127.0.0.1:6186:8080`: the locally built documentation site, available at `http://localhost:6186`.

The documentation is an independent read-only static service. It neither reads `data/` nor shares the WebUI login state. Publish port `6186` only when you need to serve the documentation externally, and protect it with firewall rules or an HTTPS reverse proxy as appropriate.

Publishing `6199` does not change the OneBot listener address. Only set that platform's `ws_reverse_host` to `0.0.0.0` when its OneBot client runs outside the AstrBot container. Also configure `ws_reverse_token` and restrict network access to the port.

## Development CLIs and Host Privileges

The source-built AstrBot image preinstalls the Claude Code `claude` CLI and the OpenAI Codex CLI as development tools; neither is a built-in AstrBot Agent Runner. The BTW conversation loop does not receive shell, filesystem, or sandbox tools, while plugin LLM tools and MCP tools default to the work loop. External plugins can still launch these CLIs directly, so install only trusted plugins and review their BTW loop assignment and working directory.

Do not commit long-lived Claude Code, Codex, or other service credentials to the repository or bake them into image layers. If you use `.docker-local/` to place local configuration under `/root`, verify that it remains uncommitted, that the resulting image is not distributed, and that credentials and writable workspaces follow least privilege.

`compose-with-napcat.yml` mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` into the AstrBot container by default for local capabilities that need Docker. A process with access to that socket can usually gain near-root control of the host. Remove the mount when those capabilities are not needed; otherwise treat Dashboard access, administrator accounts, and plugin installation as a privileged management surface.

## Start AstrBot and NapCat Together

The file currently also sets NapCat `MODE=astrbot`. On every NapCat startup, that mode writes a **reverse** WebSocket client targeting `ws://astrbot:6199/ws`. To use AstrBot's currently recommended dedicated `NapCat` platform, change it first to:

```yaml
- MODE=ws
```

`MODE=ws` starts a OneBot v11 forward WebSocket server on `0.0.0.0:3001`. Then start the stack:

```bash
docker compose -f compose-with-napcat.yml up -d --build
docker compose -f compose-with-napcat.yml logs -f astrbot docs napcat
```

On Linux, you can run NapCat with your host user's UID/GID to reduce bind-mount permission issues:

```bash
NAPCAT_UID=$(id -u) NAPCAT_GID=$(id -g) \
  docker compose -f compose-with-napcat.yml up -d --build
```

This Compose file publishes (host ports bind to loopback by default):

- `6185`: AstrBot WebUI.
- `6186`: the locally built documentation site.
- `6099`: NapCat WebUI.

It persists:

- `./data`
- `./napcat/config`
- `./ntqq`

AstrBot and NapCat share an internal Docker network. With `MODE=ws`, create the dedicated `NapCat` platform in AstrBot and set `ws_url` to `ws://napcat:3001`. If NapCat's forward WebSocket uses a token, configure the same token on both sides. This path does not require publishing a QQ WebSocket port to the host.

> [!NOTE]
> NapCat `MODE` selects a startup template and rewrites `onebot11.json` on every start; the template token is empty. To persist a custom token, start once with `MODE=ws`, remove `MODE` from the Compose file, and then set the token in NapCat WebUI. The resulting configuration remains under `./napcat/config`.

If you retain the Compose file's original `MODE=astrbot`, do not create the dedicated `NapCat` platform. Create `OneBot v11`, set `ws_reverse_host` to `0.0.0.0`, and keep port `6199`. It only needs to be reachable on the internal Docker network and does not need to be published to the host. For authentication, likewise remove `MODE` after the initial configuration is generated, then set the same token in NapCat and AstrBot.

## First Login and Updates

On first startup, AstrBot prints the WebUI address and a random initial password in its logs. The default username is `astrbot`. Change the password immediately after logging in.

To update, back up `data/`, pull the latest code, and rebuild the selected service:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
docker compose up -d --build
```

For the NapCat stack, use:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
docker compose -f compose-with-napcat.yml up -d --build
```
